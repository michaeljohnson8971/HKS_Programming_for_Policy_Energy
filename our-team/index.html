        <h1>About Us!</h1>
        <h2>Kevin Chen</h2>
    <p> Kevin specializes in generation interconnection, transmission planning, electricity market analysis, steady-state designs, and dynamic studies of wind farms, centralized and distributed solar stations, and DC/AC coupled and stand-alone Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). 

Kevin has been involved in the planning and design of more than 1-Gigawatt power plant generation capacity, including the development, estimation, pre-construction, engineering and design, construction, and post-energization phases. I support the development of wind, solar, and BESS projects for numerous clients with varying scopes (e.g., Detailed Design, Owner's Engineering, and Independent Engineering). 

Kevin's experience includes collection system design, North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) compliance study, interconnection feasibility study, layout development, EPC specification development, technical due diligence, project finance, and solar and wind production estimates.

Kevin is also a pioneer in Transmission and Distribution Co-simulation and the Techno-economic Analysis of Battery Energy Storage Systems in Transmission Systems. 

Kevin is a Licensed Professional Engineer in California and Texas. I hold a Doctor of Philosophy in Electrical Engineering (Ph.D.) from Colorado School of Mines and a Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) from Johns Hopkins University. I am currently pursuing a Master in Public Administration (M.P.A.), specializing in Infrastructure and Energy, at Harvard University.</p>
