<p> Texas is the largest net energy producer in the continental United States. The state produces order of magnitudes more than whole regions of the US. However even given the ample production prices have continued to rise within the state and across the nation. Up until the early 2000’s Texas and the US faced a looming energy crisis not meeting essential demand for energy. This was in part due to inflation and a shortfalls in production in the global energy market. <a href="(IMF- https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/oil/2000/)">(Source - International Monetary Fund)</a>  However through federal investment, and local policy change energy production in Texas was increased as differing forms of natural gas and crude oil extraction were leveraged. This was the advent of fracking a controversial yet transformative energy extraction process. (Dallas Federal Reserve Dallas Federal Reserve )Texas leads the nation in this  more expensive and labor intensive practice is supplanting energy demand need with a rather expensive and hazardous extraction process. 

The current economic shock due to the pandemic, soaring energy prices and rampant inflation mirror the crisis of the early 2000’s . Texas’s  production exceeds demand  by half but given the more expensive production process residential, commercial and industrial consumers are paying higher and higher energy prices. (Energy Information Administration State Profile) The cost of accessing scarcer fossil fuel has positioned renewable as a viable alternative. 2020 was the first year that renewable energy generation surpassed coal. Coal based energy production has had a precipitous decline. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/10/climate/us-carbon-emissions-2022.html">(Source:New York Times)</a> If proper federal investment and industry buy-in is fostered, the Texan market could be a fairly lucrative for construction and labor to transition Texas into the 22 century as another iteration of a energy juggernaut for the country.
